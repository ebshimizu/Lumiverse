* \section intro_sec Introduction
*
* Lumiverse is a framework for creating lighting control applications.
*
* \section install_sec Installation
*
* * Install CMake (> 2.8 suggested)
* * Install build dependencies for specific modules:
*      * DMX USB PRO MK2 driver: ftd2xx
*      * Bindings for other languages: SWIG (>= 3.0.0)
*    	     * Python: Python
*    	     * C#: .NET (any version that works with SWIG)
* * Make a folder to contain all of your build files
* * Inside of the folder you made, run `cmake ../source`
* * Build
*
* \section platforms Supported Platforms and Interfaces
* Lumiverse supports Windows, OS X, and iOS. Linux has some small issues at the
* moment preventing the project from compiling. I had some issues with the
* FTD2XX driver on OS X, so your mileage with OS X may vary.
*
* At the moment, Lumiverse only has drivers for ENTTEC's DMX PRO MkII devices,
* and has only been tested using one connected DMX PRO device at a time. iOS
* supports none of the USB interfaces. It should support Art-Net and other
* DMX over IP protocols at some point in the future, but I've run it with
* a Socket.IO interface just fine.

/*! \namespace Lumiverse
* \brief Contains all core Lumiverse functions and variables.

/*! \file LumiverseCore.h
* \brief Include file for all of LumiverseCore in one conveninent location.
*
* This file gets configured according to the interfaces you selected in the cmake
* build settings. Only includes the headers in LumiverseCore. You must include
* other headers separately
