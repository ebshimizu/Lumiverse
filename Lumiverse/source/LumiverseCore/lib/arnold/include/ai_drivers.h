/** \defgroup ai_drivers Output Driver Nodes
 *
 *  \details
 *  Arnold supports pluggable output-file writers called "drivers".
 *  This output driver mechanism provides a pluggable architecture for
 *  writing output image files using Arnold's built-in AOV pipeline.
 *  It is also possible to write to arbitrary devices, such as a window
 *  display.
 *
 *  AOVs (Arbitrary Output Values) are organized into "layers", with each
 *  layer having a particular type (such as FLOAT or RGBA).
 *
 *  Drivers receive AOVs one bucket at a time which is perfectly
 *  suited to image-formats that are tiled.  An iterator allows the
 *  driver to iterate through all the AOV layers contained in the
 *  bucket.
